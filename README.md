Lazy Tabs
An Google Chrome Extension Made by Himanshu bansal.

An extension which open all stored tabs when extension icon is pressed.I developed it because whenever i open up my laptop i have to check
5 to 6 links, clicking 6 buttons for 4 to 5 times a day was very tiring (because of my lazy nature).So to solve this problem i coded it.

I used Chrome Api to code it.As Some JavaScript Functions are causing Security issues.
